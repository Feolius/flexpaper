VERSION INFO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now this module use only free Flexpaper 2.1.2 version. So, all pdfs are shown only in flash mode. In this mode Flexpaper
take the swf file(s) generated from the pdf. Flexpaper module provides generating of swf files using pdf2swf converter
which is part of Swftools utilities collection (see the installation guide).

Document can be loaded in two ways: as one swf file per whole pdf file and as one swf file per the document page (see
formatter settings). In second case, Flexpaper has the problem with searching text in the document. To provide correct
way to search the text in the split mode, Flexpaper takes json file generated by pdf2json tool (see the installation guide).

LIMITATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As was previously said, current Flexpaper version supports only flash mode, there is no html and html5 modes. Also, all features
of Adaptive UI is not available for this version. So, it is not possible to change how the viewer look like. But despite of it,
Flexpaper support json files here.
